# petfinder
This full stack site will take in results from a survey and then compare its answers to provide you with an ideal pet companion type (cat/fish/rabbit). The app will then display the name and picture of the pet with the best overall match.

This app uses Node.js and npm express to gather the data and process it on the backend and bootstrap 4.0 for the front. The images are gathered from the free stock photos site Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/ ). Many of the questions are derived from the National Geographic Kids site (https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/games/quizzes/which-pet/). 

I hope you have fun considering a new pet in your life!
